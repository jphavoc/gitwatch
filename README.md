# gitwatch
This is a fork of the original `gitwatch` script (https://github.com/gitwatch/gitwatch) 
which makes it executable under Mac OS. In order to use this script you have to install `git`, 
`fswatch` and `greadlink`. 

## Installation from source
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/jphavoc/gitwatch.git
$ cd gitwatch
$ [sudo] install -b gitwatch.sh /usr/local/bin/gitwatch
```
## Requirements
The requirements can be installed using the package manager `brew`:
* `brew install git`
* `brew install fswatch`
* `brew install greadlink`

## Remarks
Further information can be found on the original repository.
